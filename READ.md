I created a task manager app called **My To-Do List** that allows users to add tasks and manage them in a dynamic and interactive way.   
Users can add new tasks by entering a task name, category, deadline, and selecting a status (In Progress, Completed, or Overdue). The added tasks are displayed in a list showing all the details. Users can filter tasks by category or status to see only what they need. The status of a task can be updated using a dropdown menu, and tasks with a passed deadline are automatically marked as Overdue. Tasks can also be deleted from the list using a Delete button. An Edit button allows users to load a task back into the form, make changes, and update it. All tasks are saved using local storage, so they stay even after refreshing or closing the browser.

I styled this app in a girlish way because pink is one of my favorite colors!  
The interface uses soft pastel pinks, cute rounded buttons, and a playful handwritten font to give it a sweet, personal, and more girl-oriented aesthetic.  
The goal was to make it functional and fun to use! 

During this project, I faced several challenges, such as figuring out how to store tasks in local storage and how to implement the edit and delete features correctly. At first, it was confusing to manage updating the right task or keeping the data saved after refreshing the page.

I solved these issues by exploring JavaScript documentation, reading examples, and trying out different approaches until something worked. Testing small parts of the code helped me understand what each function was doing, and gradually I was able to make everything work as expected.

If I had more time, I would make the app even more user-friendly. For example, I’d improve how editing works by avoiding prompts and letting users update tasks directly in the list. I would also like to display tasks in a more interactive and dynamic way.

If I had more time, I would continue improving this project to make it more complete and professional for my portfolio. Some of the features I’d like to add include:
Including a search bar to quickly find tasks by name or keyword.
Adding a sign-in system so each user can log in and see only their own tasks.
Displaying a progress bar or showing a percentage of completed tasks.
